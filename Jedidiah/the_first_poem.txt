We have just landed on Mars.
This place is cold and bizarre.
We’re searching for signs of life.
Can one stand here alive?
The temperature here is mild.
The number of obstacles, wild. 
This place is surprisingly bright.
It’s rather flooded with light.
The ground beneath is rather gray,
The horizon’s blue one way.
The other way it’s sickly green.
What this means is yet unseen.
It’s something I shall ponder.
While this vast terrain I wander.
On this journey my sole object
Is to help three kids on their project.
Tell those earthlings down below
They can speed here- no one will know.
Not that I can really speed,
I’m just a rover, I concede.
I will capture all I can,
I’ll take a shot at that man,
And send it all down to earth-
To that blazing Texas hearth.
This place is dreary and bleak.
I hear my tires squeak.
But other than that
There’s no sound on this flat.
I quietly creep like a cat.
But wait! What noise was that?
Perhaps some squeaking of shoes?
Oh, danger overhead brews!
Does Mars hold aliens?
Or worse yet- dreadful humans?
